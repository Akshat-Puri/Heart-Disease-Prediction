# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Prediction and diagnosing heart disease is the biggest challenge in the medical industry and relies on the 
factors such as the physical examination, symptoms and signs of the patient. The correct prediction of heart 
disease can prevent life threats, and incorrect prediction can prove to be fatal at the same time. In this 
project different machine learning algorithms and deep learning are applied to compare the results and 
analysis of the heart disease dataset to train a model for the task of heart disease prediction using Machine 
Learning.
